  "I was only 9 years old.\nI loved Shrek so much, I had all the merchandise and movies.\nI pray to Shrek every night, thanking him for the life I’ve been given. “Shrek is love” I say, “Shrek is life.\"\nMy dad hears me and calls me a faggot. I knew he was just jealous of my devotion to Shrek.\nI called him a cunt.\nHe hits me and sends me to sleep.\nI'm crying now and my face hurts.\nI lay in bed, really cold. I feel something warm...\nIt's Shrek! I was so happy.\nHe whispers in my ear \"This is my swamp.\"\nHe grabs me with his ogre hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I'm ready.\nI spread my ass cheeks for Shrek.\nHe penetrates my butthole.\nIt hurts so much, but I do it for Shrek. I can feel my butt tearing and eyes watering.\nI want to please Shrek.\nHe roars a mighty roar as he fills my butt with his love.\nMy dad walks in.\nShrek looks him straight in the eye and says,\n\"It's all ogre now.\"\nShrek leaves through my window.\nShrek is love. Shrek is life.",
  "Let me interject for a moment. What you guys are referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called \"Linux\", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called \"Linux\" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux. Thank you for taking your time to cooperate with with me, your friendly GNU+Linux neighbor, Richard Stallman.",
